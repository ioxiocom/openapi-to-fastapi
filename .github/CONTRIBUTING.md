## How to contribute

1. **Discuss first:** Before tackling a significant change or feature, please open an issue to discuss your idea. This helps ensure it aligns with the project's goals and avoids wasted effort.

2. **Code style & formatting:** We aim for consistent code style throughout the project. 
   * Please run any automated formatting tools included in this repository (e.g., `pre-commit`, `prettier`, `ruff`, `go fmt`). Check the `.editorconfig` or build scripts for details.
   * Try to follow existing coding conventions within the codebase.

3. **Submit a pull request:** When you're ready to contribute:
    * Create a pull request against the `main` branch.

        * **Why did you make this change?** What problem does it solve or what improvement does it offer?
        * **Output Changes (if applicable):** If your changes affect the output of the project (e.g., UI, logs), please include screenshots *before and after* to illustrate the impact.

4. **Be patient:** We are a small team with limited time dedicated to managing this repository. We will review pull requests as quickly as possible, but it may take some time. Your patience is greatly appreciated!
